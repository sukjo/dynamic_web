# Final Project (WIP)

A collective image gallery made with React, react-router-dom, react-grid-dnd, Formik, and Firebase.

### 12.13 Status

- Can't get upload form to work successfully (I suspect the issue is Formik rather than Firebase), so I'm using images uploaded directly to backend for demonstration purposes.
- Need to connect Firestore Database so I can collect metadata on user-uploaded images.
- Need to add more styling and animation, but intentionally did not use a UI library because I like using vanilla CSS.
