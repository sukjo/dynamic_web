# Week 2 Updates

# Week 3 Updates

- Added other students' recipes
- Changed rating buttons to stay fixed to right side
- Changed rating buttons to disappear when no more removal or addition is possible, but couldn't get them to update exactly when the counter reached 0 or 5 since React only checked for an updated count upon click
- Added overall page header
