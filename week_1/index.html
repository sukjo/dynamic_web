    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>100 g (3 1/2 oz.) kuzu powder</li>
      <li>50 g (1 3/4 oz.) white sugar</li>
      <li>500 ml (2 1/2 cups + 2 tbs). water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Mix all ingredients together in a small pan.</li>
      <li>
        Heat over medium-low heat, sitrring consistently. As it heats up, the
        mixture will start clumping.
      </li>
      <li>Keep stirring vigorously as the mixture gets thicker.</li>
      <li>
        When the entire mixture is translucent and you can lift it off the
        bottom of the pan, it's done cooking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the thickened mixture into a square container and smooth out the
        top as well as you can with a wet spatula. The mixture will get cloudier
        as it cools. Let it cool down to room temperature, then refrigerate for
        at least an hour, or until completely cold.
      </li>
      <li>
        To serve, take the block out of the container and cut it into cubes.
        Kuzumochi is typically serves with molasses or black sugar syrup and
        toasted, ground soybean powder. You can also add other toppings to your
        liking, such as fruit preserves, fresh fruit with honey or syrup, or
        even condensed milk.
      </li>
    </ol>
