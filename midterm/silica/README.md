# 10.15 Progress

Can't get `react-grid-dnd` swap function to work. Keep getting a TypeError that says the sourceId of the gridItem being swapped is undefined. As far as I know, I've translated the onChange (in my case handleChange) function appropriately according to multiple examples. I suspect it has something to do with my importing data via .js file instead of an array written directly into `App.js`.
