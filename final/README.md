# Final Project

A collective image gallery made with React, react-router-dom, Formik, Yup, Firestore, and Firebase Storage.

## 12.22 Updates

- Got upload form working successfully.
- Still working on edit action in Profile page.

## 12.13 Status

- Can't get upload form to work successfully (I suspect the issue is Formik rather than Firebase), so I'm using images uploaded directly to backend for demonstration purposes.
- Need to connect Firestore Database so I can collect metadata on user-uploaded images.
- Need to add more styling and animation, but intentionally did not use a UI library because I like using vanilla CSS.
